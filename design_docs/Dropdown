# Dropdown
	- When the dropdown is visible and the user clicks outside of the view, close the dropdown
	- How to work with it?
		- in setupActionBar() / cleanupActionBar()
			- actionBar.getDropdownFrame().addView() to add
			- actionBar.getDropdownFrame().removeViewById() to remove
		- in click listeners
			- keep reference to dropdown frame
			- call toggleViewById(int id)
		- what if a view wants to specify a custom animation to be used for itself?
			- toggleViewById(int id, int inAnim, int outAnim)


## Overflow menu
	- All items inside need to support default / focused / clicked (and potentially disabled) states
	- Part of an ActionBar activity
	- The ActionBar is how you interface with it.
	- Animation should be customizable (but default should look like it does in Hacker News)
	- Setup should be simple - addOverflowItem
	- Ideally (eventually) this should happen automatically when you add an ActionBarButton & there isn't room
