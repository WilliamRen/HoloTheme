Sidescreen
	- Like in the Facebook app - a screen that slides over to cover most (but not all) of the screen and has additional controls
	- How to build?
		- First instinct is to generate a bitmap from the "main" screen and use that for the sliver
			- See how it performs?
			- This isn't what the facebook app does
		- Has someone else built it?
			- Found an implementation very similar to what I was imagineing online
