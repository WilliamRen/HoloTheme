# HoloTheme
This is a collection of useful code that I share between applications. A lot of it is related to using Holo-themed components on Android 2.1+. This is an Android library project. The easiest way to use it is to git clone the project somewhere, import it into Eclipse, and add it as a library to your project.



TODO: better explanation of what is available here, how to use, etc.

# License

Some code is forked from other projects (com.slidingmenu) or the Android source code (com.airlocksoftware.holo.picker.*) and still falls under the licenses they were released under.
